"""This module provides ultrasonic distance sensing for the EchoNav system.

Last Modified: 21/10/2025

This module defines two main classes:

- UltrasonicSensor: handles a single ultrasonic sensor, managing GPIO setup,
  triggering, timing, and distance measurement.
- UltrasonicCapture: manages multiple sensors (front, rear, etc.), aggregates
  their readings, and handles cleanup.

The system operates on the principle that the time taken for a sound pulse to
travel to an obstacle and back can be used to calculate distance. It uses
the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins for trigger and echo control.
